Comprehensive Guide to Installing Velodyne Decoder 2.3.0 and Efficiently Parsing and Uploading ROS Bag Files

This walkthrough to install Velodyne_Decoder-2.3.0 only works for Python version 3.10. Any other packages used for the bag_to_csv_py3.py script also need to be installed in Python version 3.10.

Use py -3.10 only if your standard python is not 3.10 otherwise just use py.
General Steps:
1.	Open a terminal.
2.	Check Python version:
py --version

3.	If Python isnâ€™t installed, install Python version 3.10.
4.	If Python is installed, make sure it is version 3.10 (download if needed):
py -0
 
5.	To use Python 3.10:
py -3.10
 
6.	Check pip version:
py -3.10 -m pip --version

7.	To install pip:
py -3.10 -m ensurepip --default-pip
 
8.	To update pip:
py -3.10 -m pip install --upgrade pip
 
9.	Optional: (error due to setting up build wheels)
py -3.10 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

  cd velodyne-decoder-2.3.0
  mv test_velodyne_decoder.py ..
  cd ..
  python test_velodyne_decoder.py

Running the Script:

2)	Run the script:
py -3.10 bag_to_csv_py3.py
 
If you get an error: "ndarray is not C-contiguous" - add the line in the script:
points = np.ascontiguousarray(points)

Above the line:
